Dear Dr. Graham (& Jenny),

For this week, I decided to do something a little different. [Hope you enjoy!](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/3f10e63fc07b3d0e9fe302f2e4b512f2/exit-ticket/index.html)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for all youre help in these last few weeks. This course has been quite enlightening. It didn't so much five me a set of concrete tools than a new approach, a new outlook, to historical analysis. It showed me just a handful of the many different ways you can collect, analyze, and display data. Since my storymap doesn't really cover them in detail, below I have given myself a grade on each of the 5 learning outcomes described on the course website:

1. "analyze and assess historical documents, artifacts, and other primary sources"

This is a point I became intimately familiar with over the course of the last two months. In the public consciousness, we tend to assume that historical documents are widely and easily accessible to everyone. But we rarely go out and try to actually find them. In this course, exploring different archives and reading various articles about them, I realized the constant, impassioned labour that goes into all of these resources. I also realized how often the data can be extremely difficult to work with, even after all that ("messy data," as one of the readings called it). A

2. "analyze and assess critically digital tools and methods from a historical perspective."

The critical assessing of the tools we worked with was something I attempted to do throughout the course in my journals. I generally favoured the less code-heavy, user-friendly interfaces, despite knowing their limitations. If I were to continue in this field, I'm sure I would graduate out of this eventually. B+

3. "ability to conduct such research independently" and "learn to build upon each others’ work in a collaborative fashion."

I certainly sought out asssitance from others to work through challenges I encountered. However, in the realm of collaboration I wish I had done more. I benefitted from the open access data and programs which other digital historians had established, and this course did reinvigorate my love for the collaborative atmosphere of open-source digital spaces. 

I very much enjoyed the blog posts and articles we read, which linked to the tweets and other articles that inspired them. It gave me a chance to see this collaborative process play out in the digital sphere. In that vein, I sometimes tweeted about and asked for input from friends on twitter, and tried to fold in the *mise à jour* into whatever I was currently working on. But I did not get into any nitty-fritty collaborative partnerships myself. I do think that the nature of having a fully-online course was part of what prevented that, at least for me. It's harder to strike up a casual conversation with somebody when you're not in the same room. A

4. "the ability to translate the results of digital methods into historical argument."

This was a goal I had a lot of fun trying to fulfill. I spent a fairly long time working on my Inkscape poster, and making my sonification. I think the real challenge for me on this front is making sure I am confident in the message I am sending, that I think it is interesting, worthwhile, and a moral good. These are questions one can grapple with endlessly. A+

5. Digital work is often necessarily therefore a kind of public work, and a final outcome therefore will be a professionalized presence online.

This is probably the goal I am least sure about. I've been musing all week about whether or not it is a goal I can even honestly say I subscribe to. If I want to continue in academia, I suppose I will have to. However, at this stage in my life, my web presence has become a surprisingly large part of my identity, and I am remiss to sanitize it. Perhaps I am subconsciously equating "professsional" with "boring," which I don't think is necessarily the case. At the very least, I know I now have the tools to create a basic, professional website through something besides squarespace, if needs be.  B-

I assume this amounts to about an A.
